```sql
CREATE TABLE categories(
category_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
 customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
 last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
 email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
 password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
 order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 customer_id INT,
 order_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
 total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
 FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category_id INT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  stock_quantity INT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Categories(category_id)
);

CREATE TABLE orderdetails (
  order_detail_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  unit_price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

## 4. Denormalization for Performance Improvement  ðŸš€
In our e-commerce system, we encountered a specific case where the volume of read operations for certain attributesâ€”such as customer details, product information, and sales dataâ€”was significantly high. To address this, we implemented denormalization to optimize performance.

For example, rather than executing multiple joins across various tables to generate sales history reports, We created a denormalized sale_history table that consolidates these frequently accessed attributes into a single table. This approach reduces the need for complex joins and speeds up data retrieval, particularly for reports and queries that require this specific information.
```sql
CREATE TABLE sale_history (
  customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL

  product_id CHAR(8),
  description VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  price NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
  
  sale_no SMALLINT,
  sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
  amount NUMERIC(6,2) NOT NULL,
  
  PRIMARY KEY (sale_no)  -- cutomer_id and product_id can be repeated, but sale_no cannot
);
```

## 4. Null Values and Union Operation
we encountered a situation where retrieving data with null values in the CustomerNo field was problematic. Specifically, including these nulls in the results caused issues with the query output.
Like this query:
```sql
SELECT 
    customers.custumer_id, 
    customers.first_name, 
    customers.last_name, 
    COUNT(*) AS num_sales
FROM sales
LEFT JOIN customers ON sales.custumer_id = customers.custumer_id
GROUP BY customers.custumer_id, customers.first_name, customers.last_name
ORDER BY customers.last_name, customers.first_name;
```

Well, there's no obvious way to eliminate the nulls from the query that we've already got, but what we can do is break the original query into two: 
one that retrieves the sales for "real" customers, and one that retrieves the cash sales(e.g., a walk-in customer). As long as the results of both queries are compatible, we can then use a UNION to combine them into a single result.
```sql
SELECT 
    customers.custumer_id, 
    customers.first_name, 
    customers.last_name, 
    COUNT(*) AS num_sales
FROM sales
LEFT JOIN customers ON sales.custumer_id = customers.custumer_id
GROUP BY customers.custumer_id, customers.first_name, customers.last_name

UNION

SELECT 
    'Cash sale' AS custumer_id,
    'Cash sale' AS first_name,
    'Cash sale' AS last_name,
    COUNT(*) AS num_sales
FROM sales
WHERE sales.custumer_id IS NULL

ORDER BY last_name, first_name;

```
